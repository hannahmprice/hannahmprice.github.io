Currently, my research looks at what happens when interactions, or non-linear terms, are introduced to topological quantum models. Specifically, I am interested in the formation and behaviour of solitons as a non-linear phenomenon in these systems. My goal is to study these solitons as a probe into the topology of the underlying model, using a balance of analytical and computational work, the latter being primarily done in Python.
<br/>  <br/> I originally completed my MSci in Theoretical Physics at the University of Birmingham before joining the group. My masters project explored an inverted harmonic oscillator model and the scattering states associated with it. I also completed an internship with the University of Birmingham Mathematics Department, studying the properties of super-symmetric systems of fermions.
