My research interests may broadly be described as the study of topological phases in both quantum and classical systems.  My current work is exploring topological aspects of externally driven systems, where such a drive is periodic in time and introduces gain and loss into the system so that the resulting dynamics are described by a Hamiltonian which is non-Hermitian.
<br/>  <br/> Before joining the group, I completed my BA and MSci in the Natural Sciences Tripos at Homerton College, University of Cambridge.
