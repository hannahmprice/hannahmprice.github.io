<br/>  <br/> Broadly speaking, I’m interested in the phase transitions in quantum many-body systems. Currently, I’m studying the topological phase transitions and many-body physics of some driven theoretical models in lower dimensions, which could be realised experimentally with cold atoms in optical lattices.

I did my PhD with Dr. Frank Krüger and Dr. Michal Kwasigroch at University College London. By then my research focused on using theoretical methods to study the quantum fluctuation-induced phenomena in some strongly correlated systems, such as Kondo materials and Kitaev quantum spin liquids. In particular, I focused on a group of Dirac fermion-induced quantum criticality which could be described by the so-called Gross-Neveu-Yukawa theory.
