PhD student, University of Birmingham  <br/> Email: dgr647 (at) student.bham.ac.uk  <br/>  <br/>My research focus is on understanding synthetic dimensions in shaken harmonic traps. Specifically, I am bridging theory with experiment and studying novel interactions within the synthetic dimensions themselves. This research is underpinned by my interest in topology developed during my training year in the CDT of Topological Design.<br/>  <br/> I have a background in condensed matter physics gained during my undergrad, MSci Theoretical Physics, at the University of Birmingham. My masters project explored a 'toy' strongly repulsive Hubbard model which could describe aspects of high temperature superconductivity.
