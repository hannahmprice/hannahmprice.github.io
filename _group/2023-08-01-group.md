My research interests may broadly be described as the study of topological phases of matter. My current work applies the topological properties of zero-dimensional quantum mechanical systems to investigate associated effects occurring in the presence of a time or space-time interface where the topological properties change.
<br/>  <br/> Before joining the group, I completed my BA and MSci in the Natural Sciences Tripos at Homerton College, University of Cambridge.
